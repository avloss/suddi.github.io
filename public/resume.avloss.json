IT was challenging project, operating over massive amounts of data on diverse data sets. Anton lead development for the measurement framework, and it was always in good hands. He was effective across all stages, from planning to development to evaluation. I came to rely on him both for the quality of the output but also the accuracy of his estimates and the reliability with which he delivered results. He's also a pleasure to work with. I recommend Anton to anyone looking for a top notch engineer, and in particular for large-scale backend applications."
